Version Version# Month/Day/Year

Version 1.19.0 The Knapsack Update 4/8/20-4/9/20
-Added the map and number of shifts stored in the DataTransfer class to be used in the simulation (Patrick)
-Added a new constructor to the Map class that takes an array of Waypoints instead of an arrayList (Patrick)
-Added the removeWaypoint method to the Map class (Patrick)
-Added the loadOrderKnapsack and deliverOrderKnapsack methods to the simulation class (Patrick)
-Added the methods getKnapsackDeliveryTime and getNumKnapsackDeliveryTimes to the Drone class (Patrick)
-Added setDestination and setMeal methods to the order class (Patrick)
-Added the skipping system to the knapsack method. If the max weight order is ever first out of the available ones, it is sent to a queue
with the skipped orders and prioritized by position and how many times it was skipped. The lightest there are added first but the ones
that remain increase in priority. There check happens twice as when there are two orders left, the last could be stuck there when it
does not need to be (Patrick)
-Implemented the runKnapsack method starting as another FIFO simulation (Patrick)
-Changed the simulation to do turn around every time the drone returns to the start point and if it's going to hit its flight limit (Patrick)

-Uncommented out the start buttons functionality so that works again (Spencer)
-Fixed the calculate time method in the simulation (Patrick)
-Fixed the TSP calculation in the simulation (Josh)

first five minutes of orders loop going past five minutes, a bug where the program would crash after the last order is added, a bug where the drone would not
get the last order, and a bug where the simulation would not end on its own. (Patrick)
