# Drone-Delivery-Simulation
Team Azure's Project for COMP 350

For installation in IntelliJ:

1. Create a new JavaFX Project. If the Java14 JDK and JavaFX 14 JDK are not already installed on your device or in IntelliJ then follow steps 2-5. Double check this by navigating to "File" -> "Project Structure" and seeing if the SDK is Java 14 and the language level is "SDK Default" in the "Project" tab and in the "Libraries" tab if there is a library from the "lib" folder in the JavaFX 14 installation on your device. Otherwise, skip to step 6.

2. Download the Java14 JDK and JavaFX 14 JDK. (Available in the files tab under General of our Teams team)

3. Set the project SDK by navigating to "File" -> "Project Structure" -> "Project" (Under Project Seetings). Then click the New buttom and select JDK. Then simply navigate to the installation of the Java 14 JDK. Apply the setting once found.

4. Below that, make sure the language level is "SDK Default".

5. While remanining in "Project Structure", navigate to the "Libraries" tab which is also under "Project Settings". From there, hit the + button and select Java. Then, you will need to navigate to your installation of the JavaFX JDK for Java 14. Once you find where it is installed, you will need to select the "lib" folder within it. Once selected, hit the "OK" button. Apply the new settings.

6. Navigate to the VCS tab. Select "Checkout From Version Control" -> "GIT". Paste the Project URL into the URL box and select your desired directory for your local version of the project on your machine. Once you do this, hit the "Clone" button. You may be prompted to log in to your Github account. Once this is done, the project should be cloned onto your device.
